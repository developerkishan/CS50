Python 
In this lecture we are going to learn about the language python. This language is going to help us in knowing the fundamentals of Python .
We are marching towards high level programming language , because a lot of abstraction is seen in the python as compared to c. 
A lot of functions have been returned in python which helps to build something good by making the use of those functions. 
Python is a intrepreter language i.e it is not necessary to compile this language . 


We saw that writing program in python takes very less time and then we no longer need to worry about the memory allocation , freeing memory , pointers etc. 

So how to make out the difference between therse languages ? Why should we not choose python over c? 
- We see that python takes more memmory as compared to c. 
- Python takes more time as compared to c in order to compile the code. 
- C gives you the access to play with the memory . As in we can adjust memory according to our requirement . 

Functions -
Functions definetly plays a important role in making functions simpler. 
The functions are same as we have seen in c , its just makes things easier . 



Libraries 
import keyword is used to import any functions .


I also studied about the Horizontal scaling , Vertical Scaling.  How the cloud technologies help themselves by using the above Scaling properties ? what is the main difference in doing that ?
