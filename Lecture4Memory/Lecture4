This is the session which is going to make cs50 the cs50 .
We are going to study about Pointers , Segmentation Faults , Dynamic Memory Allocation, Stack , Heap , Buffer Overflow , File I/O Images .
What are Pointers ?
Pointers are reference to the variables or the address of the variables. 
*n 
&n

What are Segmentation Faults ?
Segmentation Faults are the faults which occurs when we try to touch the memory which is not allocated for the particular variables .

What is Dynamic Memory Allocation ?
Dynamic Memory Allocation is the allocation of memory when there is any requirement. 

What is Stack ?
Stack is the allocation of the system memory upon the creation of the variable or functions ,it helps in the running of the program smoothly . 

What is heap memory ?
Heap memory stores the global variables used by the program . 

What is buffer overflow ?
Buffer Overflow is the overflow of the stack and the heap memory . 


In this session we are going to learn about the basic building blocks of the code and what is the thing which is running on the behind .
We are going to learn about hte memory , which is the most important characterstics of a machine . 
we are infact going to know about the best ways to make the use of this memory.

when we are talking about the computer science what comes to our picture , computer science is the study of the computer , about various algorithms , about the basic building blocks of the technology .
The question which i ask to myself is why do you want to become a software developer ?
the answer is i am very much passionate about this industry especially the tech industry and it is going to bring the best out of me . 
I believe there is a reason if God made me choose this path. I want to be in a position that is going to make me feel that i am a successfull software developer . 

The answers lies in the following questions ?
is this going to make you very rich ?
I believe anything which done with the right intention is going to make you rich , i believe now i am in a position where i don't work for money anymore . Its about the learning and the skill , if i have the right amount of the passion and i am definetly going to earn more . 
There are situation where i talk a lot about money , I am not going to do it . I am going to be in that position where money is not a matter and i just want to discuss about the learning . 

Is this the thing which you are passionate about ?
Surely it is, I am quite very passionate about multiple things , and i believe tech industry is one of it . When i talk about the passionate , I truly feel that i am going to take an extra step to learn the new things.  
I am going to spend most of my time learning it .

Is this the new buzzword of the industry ?
When we talk about the technologies , there are multiple things which we can work on , Spending too much time on the same activity is not going to help you . 
We know the fact that why are we doing it. 


What is it which makes you so passionate about computer science ?
The reason about being passionate about computer science is that it is going to very powerfull invention . The day we are good with the computer and its use cases , Trust me the process is going to be very good . 
We always talk about the system , and when we have the right system , we are going to do wonders . 
The day is never going to come in which we know everything , but we should be in a position where we are ready to take any challenges in our life particularly tech industry . 
It is me who needs to find out about what am i good at , I am surely going to enjoy the process of and going to keep my systems attached to the software developer . 

Is it that the fact , it is very powerfull ?
Yes it can be one of the reason of being a software developer  , With coding we can move mountains and i strongly believe it . It is definetly going to make a industry where we are not worried about any things .We are constantly improving . 

Is this way the companies are making money ?
yes , definetly companies make a crazy amount of money knowing about the software industry.
So how do they make money ? There are many business which runs offline , for an example , - the banks - now to make the bank website running day and night , there is whole lot of process going at the background , starting from developing the website  , to adding all the required features , to deploying the website in such a manner that it works 100% . there are lot of the activities going online to take care of it . 


Does staying in this job gives u satisfaction ?
It definetly gives me satisfaction , we are going to build something which we are going to feel proud about .  
Does staying in this industry gives you a kind of satisfaction ?
Yes definetly it does . 
Is it about meeting the new people in this industry ?
Yes , it is one of the reason staying in this field , we are going to be in a position where we are aware about ourself , about our well being , about our development . 
We are going to know about the fact the , it is not going to matter .


Is this the fact that you are very good in this industry? 
No , definetly not , i come from a industry where i belong from a family in which we are taught about business, my family not being very good at studies and same was the case with me . 
But it is me which i want to do something different , something unique . 

can you tell something unique about this industry ?
Yes 
What are the fields which is going to make great about this industry ?
Does this process of learing new things is going to help u ? 
Does this process helps you to stay organized ? 
Are you going to make the best version of yourself by focusing on this technologies ? 


All we see in our machine is pixels. When we talk about the image which we are seeing in our computer , it is actually the pixels .
So , in terms of the machine when we write programming , we write code in binary and decimal representation . 
But when we talk about the colours it is represented in the Hexa Decimal format .

Till this time , we were using the string keyword in the c programming but what is it behind the scenes. 
string is just char* 
when we call the char* s = (It gives us the memory to story the string)

char *s = Kishan;
%s - s (This will give us the value of the complete string)
printf("The address is %p \n", s);
    printf("The address is %p \n", &s[0]);
    printf("The value prsent in the s is %c \n",s[4]);
    printf("The value prsent in the s is %s \n",s);
    printf("The value prsent in the s is %c \n",*s);
    printf("The value prsent in the s is %c \n",*(s+1));

    printf("The value prsent in the s is %c \n",s[1]);


When we compare the strings , we basically compare the addresses instead of the values . 
so we need to use strcmp
when we copy the strings , we basically copy the address , a slight change in one is going to result a change with the same string  .
 

 Use of malloc and free 
 To use the above function , we need to use the stdlib.h


 Garbage .

 scope 
 passing by value / passing by copy     
 passing by reference 


Stack 
 The functions such as the main functions / swap functions values are stored in the stack memory . 

 Stack overflow

 Heap overflow 

 Buffer overflow.

 Segmentation fault - It is the memory which you have tried to use but should n't be used. 


File I/O
 fopen 
 fclose
 fprintf - major takes two input , one the file name other the values what needs to be printed. 
 fscanf
 fread
 fwrite
 fseek



phonebook.c

FILE *file = fopen("Phonebook.c","a");
if(file ==NULL){
    return 1;
}
char *name = get_string("name :");
char *number = get_string("number :");

fprintf(file, "%s,%s",name , number);

cp.c 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>

typedef uint8_t BYTE;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    FILE *src = fopen(argv[1],"rb");
    FILE *dst = fopen(argv[2],"wb");

    BYTE b;
    while (fread(&b,sizeof(b),1,src)!=0){
        fwrite(&b,sizeof(b),1,dst);
    }
    fclose(src);
    fclose(dst);
}
